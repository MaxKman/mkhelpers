  saved_rankings = "none",

\arguments{
\item{m}{A gene expression matrix with genes as rows and samples / cells as columns}

\item{geneset_list}{A named list of gene sets to test}

\item{chunk_data}{Whether to process the data in multiple chunks, which can be useful to for very large matrices and allows for parallel processing (set future options accordingly in your environment, e.g. plan(future::multisession(workers = 4)))}

\item{chunk_size}{The number of samples / cells assigned to each chunk. Default: 1000}

\item{rankings_save_path}{Where to save the results of the expression ranking.}

\item{saved_rankings}{If a file path is provided here saved rankings are loaded and expression ranking is skipped.}

\item{rankings_object}{The rankings can also be directly loaded from an object in the current environment provided here}

\item{aucMaxRank_perc}{Cutoff percentage of top genes in the ranking considered for gene set enrichment analysis}

\item{expr_format}{Return gene expression information in wide or long format (default: "wide")}

\description{
This is a wrapper for AUCell (see https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AUCell.html). It first ranks all genes for each individual sample / cell by their expression. In a second step gene set enrichment is determined as described here https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/AUCell/inst/doc/AUCell.html. When rankings have been calculated once for a given data set they don't have to be re-run each time a different gene set with different parameters is tested. Therefore it makes sense to store these rankings and reload them when needed
